<p>
As early as June, after Marc proposed to me. I've been busy taking a look at wedding sites, wedding gowns, wedding themes and everything about weddings.
</p> 

<p>
I've been thinking about what will be the themes, the color motiff, what will it look like, the entourage, the principal and secondary sponsors.
</p>

<p>
The first thing we need to do though, is to look for a church. It's the pre-requisite of the venue, the reception and so on. The next thing they ask is the church. So by June, we finally decided to book a church.
</p>

<p>
But of course, sourcing out what church is quite a task for Marc and I. We agreed to have it in Manila and finally decided that it has to be at San Agustin Church. 
</p>

<p>
Church: San Agustin Church
</p>

<p>
The church is really beautiful, amazing lights it is more than a hundred year old church.
Pros:
The church is beautiful that you only need to minimally accessorize.
It has a long aisle
They provide the flowers
It's near the reception. It's just a 5-minute walk from La Castellana.
</p>
<p>
Cons:
When you want to open and close the doors, you need to pay 500 for each
Songs will be selected by the church
Strict when it comes to the dresses
Picture taking at the garden will cost 1000.
