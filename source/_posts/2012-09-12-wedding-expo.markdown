Marc and I went to the Philippines to have a vacation and finally meeting our wedding coordinator. While we were on our way to Wensha, I saw a billboard that says, there is a wedding/bridal fair. I immeadiately informed our WC about this and she took the liberty to register us and contact other suppliers that we need to meet, maximizing our stay.

Starting Sunday till Tuesday has been very busy days. No moment for meeting friends and shopping.
</p>
<p>
Sunday afternoon, after our family lunch at Max's Restaurant in SM San Lazaro, we headed to Pergola, where Hizon has scheduled a food tasting activity. The food is great and the staff are friendly. Lots of freebies too if we'll get their service.
</p>
<p>
At Pergola - one of the places we've been checking is small for 200 guests. So, we've crossed out Pergola but i'ts a good venue if guest is just around 120-150.

The bridal fair is at MOA where we have another food tasting activity( yes, again!). Claire advised us as we enter the expo, that we shouldn't be overwhelmed of what's inside. She also told us that, we don't need to decide instantly. What we need to instead is to check out what are the stuff and what will be helpful for our wedding.
</p>
<p>
We first went to the Lights and Sounds and the musicians, so as per Claire, we just registered and exchanged contact numbers. Since, Claire is with us, she was the one communicating and explaining. I just realized that in these days, getting married is not as cheap anymore especially if you want to have it a more memorable one. I would like to just have it a simple but a memorable one. Something that will be cherished by guests and would really impact us as we celebrate, that this is the beginning of forever.

Tiny details like invitations, cocktails were not a priority at the moment, so we skip. We proceeded to the caterers, even if I am already buying in Hizon's offer, we still asked around other caterers and finally conviced that Hizon's is the most affordable one. But we still conrinue searching, just killing time so we could go to our next food tasting activity.

VS&F has great food too and some sort of different varieties. Though, it's expensive compare to Hizons and have a limited freebies. Maybe if im not considering the budget, then I'd probably, hire VS&F. They gave us that day to decide, so we could get a 5% discount, but even if we get the discount, it's still pricey. So, it's a good thing we were able to taste their food.

We enjoyed posing in the photobooth. So we ended up having a lot of photobooth pics. There are a lor of new now a days. New styles and cool tecnhologies are being used. 
</p>
<p>
As the day progressed, we haven't decided what to get, what will be the venue, the styles and so on. So before we exit, Claire saw booth of Smartshots, so we even got confused esp to Smartshots offfer. They offer a less expensive package with so much freebies. Almost similar to Black Tie's but with nice album, free parents album, a frame and a save the date video. We got that  promo.
