The second thing we need to do is to atleast book the reception/venue and/or the Photography/Videography. So, while looking at the possible venues, we coincided to source out for the VIdeo/Photo. By August, we are already panicking which Photo/Video will be renting, so we emailed almost everyone from this industry and it's a tough one, because aside from it's expensive, you need to consider what are inclusives and the outcome. I must admit that some are quite expensive and some are just right for if you are in a tight budget.

One day, after taking a bath, I decided to look and inquire at BlackTie Project Photography. Seems they're newbie, but slowly creating their name in the market. Some of my friends who got married and soon to be married booked BlackTie. 
So, at that night, we immediately met and booked Marco's team. They are group of young photographers but an experienced ones.
